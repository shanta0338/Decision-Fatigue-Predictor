# Decision-Fatigue-Predictor

A machine learning project designed to predict decision fatigue levels using user data such as decision volume, task switching frequency, sleep patterns, and other behavioral indicators.

## Overview

Decision fatigue refers to the deteriorating quality of decisions after prolonged decision-making, due to depleted cognitive resources. This predictor model applies ML techniques like neural networks or gradient boosting to forecast fatigue, aiding in productivity optimization and mental health monitoring.

The project likely leverages Python frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for model training, aligning with common practices in behavioral ML applications.

## Features

- Predicts fatigue from quantifiable inputs like daily decisions and sleep quality.
- Potential visualizations including decision heatmaps or willpower battery metrics.
- Supports strategies to mitigate fatigue, such as automation suggestions.
## Dataset

Expects features relevant to decision fatigue, such as:

- Number of decisions per day
- Time of day for decisions
- Sleep duration and quality
- Task switching rate

Sample datasets may draw from public sources or simulated data mimicking real-world behavioral logs.

## Model Architecture

Employs supervised ML models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) trained on labeled fatigue indicators for binary/multi-class prediction.

Performance metrics include accuracy in identifying moderate-to-severe fatigue states.

## Contributing

Fork the repo, create a branch, make changes, and submit a PR. Focus on improving model accuracy or adding fatigue mitigation features.
