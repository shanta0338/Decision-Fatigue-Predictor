# Decision-Fatigue-Predictor

A machine learning project designed to predict decision fatigue levels using user data such as decision volume, task switching frequency, sleep patterns, and other behavioral indicators.

## Overview

Decision fatigue refers to the deteriorating quality of decisions after prolonged decision-making, due to depleted cognitive resources. This predictor model applies ML techniques like neural networks or gradient boosting to forecast fatigue, aiding in productivity optimization and mental health monitoring.

## Features

- Predicts fatigue from quantifiable inputs like daily decisions and sleep quality.
- Potential visualizations including decision heatmaps or willpower battery metrics.
- Supports strategies to mitigate fatigue, such as automation suggestions.
## Dataset

Expects features relevant to decision fatigue, such as:

- Number of decisions per day
- Time of day for decisions
- Sleep duration and quality
- Task switching rate

Sample datasets may draw from public sources or simulated data mimicking real-world behavioral logs.
